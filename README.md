# PS-Pomodoro
Simple command line timer geared at developers who wish to practise Pomodoro and also have their presence updated on Lync.

# TODO
* Presence management - If you finish Pomodoro and have a meeting booked then the script should probably preserve the "Busy" presence that meetings generally set.
* Status management - The script should reset your status back to how it was after exiting Pomodoro, the script should also let people know when you are available to be disturbed.
* Interruptions - You currently cannot end a Pomodoro session so that it can be reset after an interruption.
